Building MLP Neural Network(s) with TensorFlow


This repository contains implementations of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using TensorFlow for various datasets, including MNIST, Iris, Wine, Boston Housing, CIFAR-10, and text classification tasks. Each model is built from scratch and demonstrates how to adapt MLP architectures for different types of data, including images, tabular data, and text.
