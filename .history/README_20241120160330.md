# Building MLP Neural Network(s) with TensorFlow

It was a nice journey and some would call exploration to investigate low-level and high-level possibilities of Keras/TensorFlow module. To tell the truth I used this amazing book to learn all the details, and tricks to use TensorFlow for building aritifical neural networks.

This repository contains implementations of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using TensorFlow for various datasets, including MNIST, Iris, Wine, Boston Housing, CIFAR-10, and text classification tasks. Each model is built from scratch and demonstrates how to adapt MLP architectures for different types of data, including images, tabular data, and text.
