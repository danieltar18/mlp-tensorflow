# Building MLP Neural Network(s) with TensorFlow

It was a nice journey and some would call exploration to investigate low-level and high-level possibilities of Keras/TensorFlow module. To tell the truth I used this amazing book to learn all the details and tricks to use TensorFlow for building aritifical neural networks. 

TensorFlow in Action by Thushan Ganegedara. (https://www.amazon.com/TensorFlow-2-0-Action-Thushan-Ganegedara/dp/1617298344)

I'd say it was somewhat hard to understand and develop with EagerTensor and Eagerfunctions, which are frequently used in TensorFlow's world, although the book and the comprehensive documentations on Tensorflow.Org helped me a lot. 

About this repository: It contains implementations of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras for various datasets, including MNIST, Iris, Mercedes Benz Greener Manufacturing, Boston Housing, CIFAR-10, and text classification tasks. Some model was built from scratch with low-level Keras API, some with predefined objects like Model or Sequential. It should demonstrate how to adapt MLP architectures for different types of data, including images, tabular data, and text.
